"""v2.4 unified corpus loader tests.

Validates the PR 2 deliverable: ``load_unified_player_stats`` /
``load_corpus`` concatenate the pre-1999 PFR corpus with the canonical
1999+ nflverse stat file behind the ``USE_PRE1999_CORPUS`` feature
flag, and stitch crossover players (Emmitt Smith, Jerry Rice, Brett
Favre, ...) into a single continuous career arc via the PFR↔gsis
crosswalk.

Run with ``pytest tests/test_v2_4_corpus_loader.py -v``.
