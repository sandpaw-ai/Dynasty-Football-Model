"""Headless launcher — v2.3.4 daily-refresh pipeline.

Every step that pulls external data runs on each invocation so the
site always reflects fresh-as-of-today inputs. Phil 2026-05-22:

  "I want everything to pull from every source on a daily basis. I
   know the code is meant to run every day, but lets make sure that
   the scrapes from all of the sources runs every day as well."

Pipeline:
    [1/8]  init DB (used for Sleeper metadata + league imports)
    [2/8]  refresh nflverse caches (player_stats_season + players.csv.gz)
    [3/8]  sync Sleeper + MFL player metadata
    [4/8]  refresh KeepTradeCut consensus + dynastyprocess crosswalk
    [5/8]  run the v2.3 similarity engine
    [6/8]  build v3.0 prospect projection layer (PR 4)
    [7/8]  build the static site
    [8/8]  pre-fetch any leagues listed in leagues.json
