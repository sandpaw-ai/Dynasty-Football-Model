"""Engine entry point — v2.0 fantasy-point-arc methodology.

NOTE: the module name remains ``similarity_v1`` for back-compat with all
existing callers (``format_overlay``, ``report``, sources, tests). The
IMPLEMENTATION is the v2.0 fantasy-point-arc engine; the v1.x per-stat
z-score machinery has been removed.

Pipeline:

    1.  Load player careers from nflverse season CSV.
    2.  Classify each player as ``long_arc`` (retired before
        ``LONG_ARC_THROUGH_SEASON``, or 8+ NFL seasons, or 33+ years old
        with 6+ seasons).
    3.  Build a corpus-derived era-pace table (era 1→4, 2→4, 3→4
        multipliers per (position, stat)).
    4.  Build a FANTASY-POINT ARC for every player under every supported
        scoring format (sf_ppr, 1qb_ppr, 2qb_ppr, half_ppr, std,
        sf_te_premium). Each season's stat line is era-pace-adjusted
        BEFORE scoring, so every fp value in the arc is in
        modern-fp-equivalent units.
    5.  Build a per-(position, career_stage) percentile table from the
        long-arc corpus' career-total fp.
    6.  For each ACTIVE player, build their 10-dim arc vector at the
        current age, cosine-match against same-position long-arc players
        in an age ±1 / career-stage ±1 window, take top-20 by cosine.
    7.  Project each comp's realised post-age fantasy points
        (modern-fp-equivalent), discount 5%/yr, similarity-weight, sum.
    8.  For QBs, apply v1.1's career-length era lift on
        projected_remaining_seasons AND projected_remaining_fp (mobile /
        dual-threat only; pocket lift = 1.0). This is the ONE piece of
        v1.x machinery v2.0 keeps — modern medicine extends mobile-QB
        careers and the long-arc comp pool is still half-retired-from-
        era-3 dual-threats.

No z-scoring. No style cohort. No per-stat-shape vectors. The 10-dim
vector lives in raw fantasy-point space.
