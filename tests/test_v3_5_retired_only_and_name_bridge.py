"""v3.5 — Retired-only comp pool + name-based NFL bridge tests.

Phil's 2026-05-28 follow-up brief:

  > "We are still having an issue on comparing current NFL players to
  >  other current NFL players. Comparing Puka Nacua to Jamar Chase,
  >  Justin Jefferson, Ceedee Lamb is actually a fair comparison, but
  >  you cannot say that their seasons ended in 5 or 6 seasons for
  >  example because they are still playing... For puka (and the
  >  entire model), we should only be projecting their remaining NFL
  >  fantasy points remaining using retired players... if their 'last
  >  season' is 2025 or 'the most recent year of data' then that
  >  player should be omitted from the similarity score or comparison."

  > "you are not connecting the college players being compared to
  >  their NFL production. For example, you pull up Puka Nacua and
  >  there are nfl players like boldin whose NFL stats are not
  >  included. You need to then take that player and look them up in
  >  pro-football reference using a similar name (because remember
  >  sometimes there are data limitations like a player has a 'Jr.'
  >  or the same name, etc.)"

v3.5 fixes:
  1. Currently-active players (last_season >= current_season - 1) are
     excluded from the long_arc_corpus and broad_comp_pool used by the
     veteran similarity engine. Puka Nacua's top comps are now
     RETIRED greats (Julio Jones, Larry Fitzgerald, Dez Bryant)
     instead of still-active stars whose careers haven't played out.
  2. A name-based NFL bridge fallback joins college comps to nflverse
     when the cfb-id bridge misses. Pre-2014 college players
     (Boldin, Calvin Johnson, Hakeem Nicks, Kenny Stills) now
     surface real NFL career fp on the prospect page.
