"""Fantasy-point-arc similarity engine (v2.0.0).

REPLACES ``similarity_v1`` and ``style_cohort`` as the single source of truth
for player rankings. The methodology change vs v1.x:

    v1.0  per-stat z-score cosine on (passing_yards, passing_tds, ...) →
          flattened Allen's fantasy advantage because raw passing volume
          isn't elite for him.
    v1.1  +dual-threat career-length lift on projected_remaining_years
          (multiplicative, capped at 1.5×) → still didn't reach Allen
          top 5 because the BASE projection was z-scored.
    v1.2  per-fantasy-point-category z-scoring + style cohort → still
          z-scoring, still scale-invariant within era, still buried
          Allen.

    v2.0  COMPARE PLAYERS BY THE FANTASY POINTS THEY ACTUALLY PRODUCE.
          The vector is in RAW fantasy-point units. Two players with
          similar fp/g production curves under modern scoring are
          similar — regardless of how they earn those points (passing
          vs rushing).

The vector is 11-dim, all components in fantasy-point units (era-pace
pre-adjusted at corpus build → all values are "modern fantasy-points
equivalent"):

    v[0]  = fp_per_game at the current age (recent-season weight 1.0)
    v[1]  = fp_per_game at age-1 (weight 0.7)
    v[2]  = fp_per_game at age-2 (weight 0.5)
    v[3]  = career-avg fp_per_game through current age
    v[4]  = peak-3yr-avg fp_per_game through current age
    v[5]  = peak-single-season fp_per_game (any age through current)
    v[6]  = career-total fp through current age (scaled by /100)
    v[7]  = trajectory slope (linear regression of fp_per_game vs
            career-season-index, in fp/g per season)
    v[8]  = durability (fraction of possible games played = career_games
            / (n_seasons * 17))
    v[9]  = career-stage fp percentile within position (0-1; computed
            against long-arc corpus at the same career-season-index)
    v[10] = current_age * AGE_SCALE (added in v2.3.5 — age is a PRIMARY
            feature, not a tie-breaker; previously the engine ignored
            age in distance entirely, causing 24-yo rookies to comp
            with 22-yo late-bloomers at the same fp tier)

Similarity is computed via INVERSE-DISTANCE (1 / (1 + d/scale)) over a
feature-importance-weighted Euclidean distance, NOT cosine. We need
absolute magnitude to matter: Allen (peak fp/g ≈ 28) is NOT similar to
Daniel Jones (peak fp/g ≈ 16) even if their proportions match.
Feature weights emphasise peak / current / 3yr-peak / career-avg
(the magnitude-bearing components) and de-weight slope / durability /
percentile (noisy on small-sample careers).

The top neighbour for Josh Allen is another QB whose career-arc-to-date
actually PRODUCED similar fp/G under modern scoring. That naturally
pulls in peak-Cam-Newton, peak-Steve-Young, peak-Vick, peak-Manning,
peak-Brees regardless of running/passing split.

Per-position eligibility:
    * same position
    * is_long_arc=True
    * age within ±1 of target's current age
    * career-stage (NFL season index) within ±1 of target's
    * top-K=20 by cosine, projection is similarity-weighted

Projection:
    * For each comp, take their realised post-age fantasy points
      under the target format (already in modern-fp units).
    * Time-discount 5%/year out.
    * Weighted sum → projected_remaining_career_fantasy_points.
    * v1.1's career_length_era lift kept as a FINAL multiplier on
      projected_remaining for QBs (mobile/dual-threat) — modern medicine
      and rules continue to extend careers and the comp pool can still
      under-represent that.

The output is the SOLE dynasty value. No composite blend with v0/v1.

    Blends all-time peak (signals ceiling) with recent-3yr (signals

    lower than all-time peak — the blend pulls the anchor down. For a
    young rising player (Daniels, Allen at 28), recent ~= peak so the
    blend stays near peak.

    Formula: max(recent_3yr * 1.10, peak_3yr * 0.90)

          slightly understates what they'll produce next year (one
          down year shouldn't crash the projection).
        - 0.90×peak: a soft floor — a player who sustained an elite
          3-year peak retains most of that ceiling potential. A 10%
          discount acknowledges the typical year-on-year regression.
        - max() of the two: if the player is at peak form (Allen,
          Hurts, Daniels), recent×1.1 dominates. If the player has
          declined recently (Mahomes 2023-24, Rodgers 2024), 0.9×peak
