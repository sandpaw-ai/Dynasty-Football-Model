"""v3.0 PR 4 — orchestrate the prospect projection layer.

Reads (or rebuilds) the PR 3 prospect corpus, finds top-25 comps for
every recent draft-class prospect (skill positions only), projects an
NFL career arc from comp NFL careers (similarity-weighted), and writes
JSON artifacts that PR 6's UI consumes.

Draft-class convention (Phil's wording in the brief):
    draft_class_year = last_college_season + 1
The brief asked for draft classes 2022..2026 inclusive, which maps to
last-college-season ∈ {2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025}.

Outputs:
    data/engine_v3/prospects_<draft_class>.json     (one per class)
    data/engine_v3/prospects_all.json               (aggregated)

Usage::

    PYTHONPATH=src python3 scripts/build_prospects_v3.py \
        [--corpus data/engine_v3/prospect_corpus.json.gz] \
        [--bridge data/bridge/ncaa_to_nfl.json] \
        [--ktc    data/consensus/ktc_latest.json] \
        [--nfl    data/nflverse/player_stats_season.csv.gz] \
        [--out-dir data/engine_v3] \
        [--classes 2022,2023,2024,2025,2026] \
        [--top-k 25]

Idempotent: re-running with the same inputs is a no-op overwrite that
produces byte-identical artifacts when KTC + corpus haven't changed.
