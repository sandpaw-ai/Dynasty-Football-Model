# Dynasty Football Model

A composite dynasty fantasy football ranking model. Pulls from multiple
public data sources, weights each source by its historical accuracy, and
publishes a blended top-300 with **buy / sell signals** based on where the
model disagrees with the broader fantasy market.

Output is a self-contained `dynasty_rankings.html` you can open in any browser.

## Quick start (non-technical users)

1. Install Python 3.12 — https://www.python.org/downloads/ (on Windows,
   check "Add Python to PATH" during install).
2. Double-click the script for your OS:
   - macOS → `RUN_ME_MAC.command`
   - Windows → `RUN_ME_WINDOWS.bat`
3. The script sets up everything on first run (~1 min), syncs sources,
   computes the model, and opens the rankings page in your browser.

To refresh later, just double-click the script again (~10s).

See `READ_ME_FIRST.txt` for security-warning workarounds (macOS Gatekeeper,
Windows SmartScreen) and troubleshooting.

## Methodology

The model is a **weighted composite** of independent ranking sources. Each
source's weight is multiplied by a track-record factor derived from backtests
against real NFL fantasy production.

### 1. Pull from many sources

Each source is an adapter (`src/dynasty/sources/*.py`) that returns
normalized `RankingRecord`s. Sources are categorized:

| Category     | Meaning                                              | Examples                  |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `market`     | Reflects real fantasy-manager behavior / trades      | FantasyCalc               |
| `aggregator` | Blends many experts into a consensus                 | FantasyPros ECR, DynastyProcess |
| `expert`     | A single analyst's published list                    | Manual CSV imports        |
| `model`      | Algorithmic prospect / dynasty model                 | Brainy Ballers SPS, PFF   |

The Sleeper player API is used purely for **canonical ID resolution** — every
player is tied to a `sleeper_id`, which cross-references MFL, ESPN, Yahoo,
FantasyCalc, etc.

### 2. Normalize each source

For each source we either:

- Convert overall rank to a 0–100 score with linear decay over a depth of
  300 (rank 1 = 100, rank 300 = 0, rank > 300 = 0), **or**
- Rescale the source's native `market_value` (e.g. FantasyCalc trade values)
  to 0–100 against that source's top value.

### 3. Weight by track record

Each source has a `default_weight`. At score time we multiply by a
**track-record multiplier** derived from backtests against actual NFL
production:

| Spearman \|ρ\| vs. realized production | Multiplier |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------:|
| ≥ 0.70                                  | 1.5        |
| ≥ 0.50                                  | 1.2        |
| ≥ 0.30                                  | 1.0        |
| < 0.30                                  | 0.6        |
| no backtest yet                         | 1.0        |

This means **the more accurately a source has predicted the future, the more
the model listens to it**. Sources that have not been backtested yet are
treated as neutral (multiplier = 1.0).

### 4. Composite

For every player, composite score = weighted average of available per-source
scores. Players are then ranked overall and per-position.

### 5. Consensus divergence (buy / sell signals)

Separately, the model computes a "market consensus rank" using only the
`market` and `aggregator` sources — i.e. where the broader fantasy community
has the player.

```
rank_divergence = consensus_rank − model_rank
```

- **Positive divergence** → the model likes the player more than the market →
  **buy signal**
- **Negative divergence** → the model lower than the market →
  **sell signal**

This is the most useful column for actually playing dynasty: it tells you
where the model thinks the market is wrong.

### 6. Tiers

Composite ranks are bucketed into simple tiers (T1: top 6, T2: 7–12, T3:
13–24, etc.) for portfolio-level decisions.

| Manual CSV            | expert      | ✅ via `dynasty.manual_import.import_csv` |

> **Note on KeepTradeCut:** KTC's ToS forbids scraping. FantasyCalc is the
> closest legal substitute — values come from real fantasy-manager trades

Adding a new source: implement `BaseSource` in `src/dynasty/sources/new_source.py`,
register it in `sources/__init__.py`, and the rest of the pipeline (player
resolution, time-series storage, composite scoring, backtest weighting)
picks it up automatically.

---

## Backtesting

Every source's accuracy can be measured against realized NFL fantasy
production:

```bash
python -m dynasty.cli backtest fantasycalc --years 2020,2021,2022 --window 3
```

This writes a `source_track_record` row containing Spearman correlation,
R², MAE, and top-12 / top-24 hit-rate over an outcome window of `N` seasons.
The next time you run `score`, that source's weight is automatically
adjusted by the track-record multiplier table above.

---

## Data model

Five tables (SQLAlchemy 2.0 ORM, SQLite by default — set `DATABASE_URL`
to use Postgres):

- `players` — canonical entity, keyed by `sleeper_id`; cross-references
  `mfl_id`, `espn_id`, `yahoo_id`, etc.
- `sources` — one row per ranking source.
- `rankings` — **time-series**: every sync appends; never overwrites. This
  is what powers trend signals and backtests.
- `production` — actual NFL fantasy production by season / week.
- `evaluations` — granular per-metric scores (PFF grades, Reception
  Perception route data, model outputs).
- `composite_scores` — model output, append-only history with breakdown JSON.
- `source_track_record` — per-source backtest results that feed the weighting.

See `src/dynasty/db/models.py` for the full schema.

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit as needed:

```ini
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///dynasty.db
FANTASYPROS_API_KEY=        # optional, enables fantasypros source
PFF_API_KEY=                # optional, enables pff source
REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=30
```

## Roadmap

Research foundation: see `docs/RESEARCH-sources.md` (440-line writeup of the
source landscape with statistical evidence and per-source weighting
recommendations) and `docs/CHANGELOG-model.md` (running log of what each
release changes about the score outputs and why).

Near-term:

- ~~**FantasyFootballCalculator ADP** — second free market signal, complements
  FantasyCalc.~~ (PR #3 — done)
- ~~**RAS (Relative Athletic Score)** — Kent Lee Platte's free CSV. Best free
  athleticism composite; especially useful as a tail-risk filter.~~ (PR #4 — done)
- **Breakout Age + College Dominator** — computed from `cfbd-api-py` college
  stats. Replicates ~80% of PlayerProfiler's "secret sauce" for free. (PR #5)
- **Position-specific + years-pro weighting** — the same source should not
  weight the same for a rookie WR and a Year-6 RB. Refactors
  `SourceTrackRecord` lookup to apply position-level multipliers. (PR #6)
- **League roster import (MFL + Sleeper)** — KeepTradeCut-style "rate my
  team / league" view from the user's actual rosters. (PR #7)

Later:

- Additional model-grade prospect sources via manual CSV (Reception Perception,
  PFF Big Board, Matt Waldman RSP, Dane Brugler "Beast", Hayden Winks).
- Trade calculator (sum of values on each side, with positional scarcity
  adjustment).
- Mock-draft tool for rookie drafts.
