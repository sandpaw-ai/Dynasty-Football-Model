"""v2.2.0 — survival / confidence / late-breakout penalty multipliers.

Phil's v2.1 critique (verbatim): three different players that all rank
too high (Anthony Richardson #23, Bo Nix #2, Shedeur Sanders #77) share
a common methodological root cause. The v2.0/v2.1 engines project
forward by similarity-weighting comps' realised post-snapshot fantasy
points and (optionally) anchoring on the target's peak fp/G. Neither
path explicitly punishes a player for:

    1) having a comp pool of bust-tier short-career players
       (Richardson's comps are Trubisky/Bridgewater/RG3 post-rookie/
       Tyrod Taylor — careers shorter than 6 NFL seasons and
       collapsed by age 30),

    2) tiny NFL career sample size (Richardson ~15 starts, Sanders
       ~5 starts — projecting their fp/G forward at face value
       overstates the signal), or

    3) late-breakout age — historical QBs whose first ≥250-pass-attempt
       season came at age 24-25+ had substantially shorter productive
       careers than QBs who broke out at 22 (Brian Hoyer, Ryan
       Fitzpatrick, Aaron Brooks tier).

This module computes three independent multiplicative penalties applied
in v2.2's projection pipeline:

    survival_multiplier        : derived from comp pool career-length
                                 statistics (long-arc comps' realised
                                 careers).
    confidence_shrinkage       : Bayesian-style pull toward the position
                                 tier baseline based on the target's
                                 own career NFL starts.
    late_breakout_penalty      : QB-only; multiplier in [0.80, 1.0]
                                 keyed to breakout_age.

Composition order (applied by ``apply_penalty_stack``):

    proj_raw    = comp-weighted (or peak-anchored, whichever the engine
                  has chosen) projection
    after_surv  = proj_raw * survival_multiplier
    after_conf  = after_surv * confidence + baseline * (1 - confidence)
    final       = after_conf * late_breakout_penalty   (QB only)

Floor: 0.2 × proj_raw (so we never zero a player out).
Ceiling: proj_raw (no boost above the raw projection — penalties are
penalties, not lifts).

# the original `starts / 32` math (0.6 × 29 / 32 = 0.544).
#
# v2.3.2 change: use raw games-played for non-QBs (drop the 0.6
# starter discount — WR/RB/TE don't have a clean starter concept; if
# the player accumulated NFL fp/g it counts) and lower the full-confidence
# threshold to 30 games (~1.75 NFL seasons). MHJ moves from

# Players who DID NOT PLAY in the most recent NFL season (or only got
# a handful of games) have their projection haircut. Phil:
#   "Joe Mixon did not play in 2025 (the most recent season). It is
#    fair to attribute that to injury or off the field issues...
#    either of which should penalize the player."
#
# The penalty looks at the gap between the player's most-recent
# qualifying season and the corpus's most-recent season. Each missed
# full season is taxed multiplicatively. A partial-season miss (played
# <8 games in the most recent season) takes a smaller haircut.

# played yet) or to players whose nflverse player_id is missing from

# v3.7 (Phil 2026-05-28): partial-season penalty now scales linearly
# by games played. Pre-v3.7 it was a step function: <8 games → 0.85.
# Phil's Kyler Murray example: 5 games in 2025 = 12 missed games, but
# only a 0.85 multiplier felt light. v3.7 scales between
# MISSED_FULL_SEASON_MULTIPLIER (at 0 games — effectively a full miss)
# and 1.0 (at FULL_SEASON_GAMES = 17 games played). 5 games →
# 0.70 + (5/17)*(1.0-0.70) = 0.70 + 0.088 = 0.788, which is a real
# 21% haircut. Kyler now reflects the injury impact properly.
#
# We keep PARTIAL_SEASON_MULTIPLIER as a backstop ceiling: a player
# who played 16 of 17 games should not be penalized more than the
# minor PARTIAL_SEASON_MULTIPLIER — we still want to call out partial
# absence even when it's only one game.
